# ATLIQ_Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI_Project

I have completed Codebasics Resume Project as part of my Data Project Portfolio development. This Project provided me with a valuable opportunity to enhance my Data Analysis skills. I put forth my utmost effort to successfully complete the Project, and I am eagerly looking forward to receiving constructive feedback to further improve my skills for future projects.

I'm excited to share my first Power BI report, which focuses on revenue analysis for AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the hospitality industry. AtliQ Grands has been operating five-star hotels across India for the past two decades. However, recent challenges such as increased competition and ineffective decision-making have led to a decline in their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment.I was tasked with creating insights and a dashboard to provide actionable information for revenue management.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to leverage historical data to identify revenue opportunities and provide valuable insights to AtliQ Grands. By analyzing key metrics and creating a comprehensive dashboard, we aim to equip the revenue management team with the necessary information to make data-driven decisions and drive revenue growth.

## Task

As a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.
1) Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2) Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3) Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Approach

To accomplish the task at hand, I followed a systematic approach:

Data Collection: I received sample data from AtliQ Grands, which included information on bookings, room rates, customer profiles, and other relevant revenue-related data. This dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis.

Metric Creation: Using the provided metric list, I created the necessary metrics to measure revenue performance accurately. These metrics include RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), Occupancy Rate, Revenue by Hotel, and more. These metrics will enable us to assess the current revenue situation and identify areas for improvement.

Dashboard Development: I designed a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by the stakeholders. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the revenue-related metrics and their trends over time. It enables the revenue management team to visualize and explore the data easily.

Insights Generation: In addition to the metrics and mock-up dashboard, I went beyond the requirements and generated additional insights. By performing in-depth analysis, I discovered patterns, trends, and correlations in the data that were not previously identified. These insights can help AtliQ Grands uncover untapped revenue opportunities and make informed decisions.

## Things I have Learned

Data Preparation and Integration: I ensured data cleanliness by cleaning and organizing the data sets. Additionally, I connected different data sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Metric Generation and Calculation: I created measures and calculated columns to derive additional metrics beyond the provided list. This allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of the revenue data.

Insight Discovery through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted in-depth EDA to uncover valuable insights from the data. By analyzing patterns, trends, and correlations, I gained a deeper understanding of the factors impacting revenue performance.

Enhanced Filtering with Slicers: To streamline the analysis process, I utilized slicers to narrow down the data based on specific requirements. This enabled a more focused exploration of revenue-related insights.

Multi-Sheet Navigation Menu: To improve the user experience and ease of navigation, I built a menu bar that allows users to seamlessly switch between different sheets within the Power BI report. This ensures a more intuitive and organized viewing experience.

Customized Dashboard Visualization: I carefully selected specific colors for the dashboard to enhance visual appeal and improve data visualization. By choosing colors that are visually pleasing and meaningful, I aimed to make the dashboard more engaging and user-friendly.


I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Hemanand Vadivel and Dhaval Patel for granting us this wonderful opportunity to learn and demonstrate our skills through these projects. Their support and guidance have been invaluable in our professional growth.
